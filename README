DESCRIPTION
This filetype plugin provides movement commands and text objects for Vim
functions.
This is duplicated from $VIMRUNTIME/ftplugin/vim.vim, using the (IMHO) correct
mappings "move to method", not "move to paragraph".

USAGE
                        Move around Vim functions:
]m                      Go to [count] next start of a function.
]M                      Go to [count] next end of a function.
[m                      Go to [count] previous start of a function.
[M                      Go to [count] previous end of a function.

im                      "inner method" text object, select [count] function contents.
am                      "a method" text object, select [count] functions, including
                        the function definition and 'endfunction'.
